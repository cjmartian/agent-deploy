## P1 — Spec Compliance Gaps

### P1.1 Cost Estimation Uses Hardcoded Values ❌

- [ ] Add `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/pricing` to `go.mod`
- [ ] Integrate AWS Pricing API for accurate cost estimates
- [ ] Replace hardcoded formula at `aws.go:153-158`:
  - `baseCost := 15.0`
  - `ecsCost := expectedUsers * 0.02`
  - `albCost := 20.0`
- [ ] Cache pricing data to avoid repeated API calls
- **Impact:** Cost estimates are inaccurate; spec `ralph/specs/aws-provider.md` requires AWS Pricing API
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:153-158`, `go.mod`
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Verified hardcoded values, missing go.mod dependency

### P1.2 Current Spend Calculation Hardcoded ❌

- [ ] Replace hardcoded `currentSpend += 25.0` at `aws.go:220` with actual Cost Explorer data
- [ ] Cost Explorer IS implemented in `internal/spending/costs.go` but NOT called from `planInfra`
- [ ] Wire up `CostTracker.GetDeploymentCosts()` or `GetTotalMonthlySpend()`
- **Impact:** Budget checks use fake numbers; could allow overspend or wrongly block deployments
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:220`
- **Depends on:** None (P0.3 now completed)
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Verified Cost Explorer implemented but not wired to planInfra

### P1.3 Container Port Hardcoded to 80 (5 locations) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add `container_port` input parameter to deploy tool
- [x] Update task definition to use configurable port (`aws.go:814`)
- [x] Update ALB target group health checks (`aws.go:865`)
- [x] 5 hardcoded port 80 references across `aws.go`
- **Impact:** Cannot deploy apps on non-80 ports (Node.js uses 3000, Go uses 8080, etc.)
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Completed:** ContainerPort parameter added with default value of 80

### P1.4 Health Check Path Not Configurable ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add `health_check_path` input parameter
- [x] Update target group health check configuration (currently "/" at `aws.go:701`)
- **Impact:** Apps with custom health endpoints (`/health`, `/healthz`) fail ALB health checks
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Completed:** HealthCheckPath parameter added with default value of /

### P1.5 Single Replica Deployments Only ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add `desired_count` parameter to deploy tool
- [x] Update ECS service `DesiredCount` (currently always 1 at `aws.go:853`)
- **Impact:** No high availability; single point of failure; cannot scale
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Completed:** DesiredCount parameter added with default value of 1

### P1.6 No Environment Variables Support ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add `environment` map input to deploy tool
- [x] Pass environment to container definition
- **Impact:** Cannot configure apps via environment variables (common pattern)
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Completed:** Environment map parameter added for container environment variables

### P1.7 No HTTPS/TLS Support ❌

- [ ] Add optional certificate ARN parameter
- [ ] Configure ALB HTTPS listener when certificate provided
- [ ] Default to HTTP for simplicity
- **Impact:** Production deployments require HTTPS; currently HTTP only
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go` (ALB listener creation)

### P1.8 AWS Provider Not Using Structured Logging (32 instances) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Migrate 30 instances of `log.Printf()` in `aws.go` to `slog`-based structured logging
- [x] Migrate 1 instance in `provider.go`
- [x] Migrate ~4 instances in `costs.go`
- [x] Use existing `internal/logging/logging.go` infrastructure
- **Impact:** Inconsistent logging; structured logging infrastructure built but not adopted
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go` (30), `internal/providers/provider.go` (1), `internal/spending/costs.go` (~4)
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Total of 32 `log.Printf` instances identified

### P1.9 VPC CIDR Hardcoded ❌

- [ ] Make VPC CIDR configurable (currently hardcoded to `10.0.0.0/16` at `aws.go:478`)
- **Impact:** May conflict with corporate networks or VPC peering

- [ ] Add NAT Gateway for private subnet egress
- **Impact:** All resources publicly accessible; no private tier for databases/internal services
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`

### P1.12 Auto Scaling Not Implemented ❌

- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`

### P1.13 Plan Approval Bypassed ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] ✅ Plans now require explicit approval via `aws_approve_plan` tool
- [x] ✅ Added `RejectPlan()` method for explicit rejection
- [x] ✅ `createInfra` now checks for approved status, returns `ErrPlanNotApproved` otherwise
- **Impact:** Users can now review cost estimates before resources are created
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`, `internal/state/store.go`
- **Completed:** 2026-03-24

### P1.14 No Wait for Healthy Deployment ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Currently returns immediately after creating service
- [x] Implement wait for ECS service to reach RUNNING state
- [x] Check ALB health check passes
- [x] Spec `ralph/specs/aws-provider.md` requires waiting for healthy deployment
- **Impact:** Users think deployment succeeded when it may still be starting/failing
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Verified returns immediately without waiting

### P1.15 Default Docker Image ❌

- [ ] Default image is `nginx:latest` at `aws.go:787`
- [ ] Should require explicit image specification or document default clearly
- **Impact:** Accidental deployments with wrong image

- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:806-807`
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Verified hardcoded CPU=256, Memory=512

### P1.18 Error Wrapping Breaks errors.Is() ❌

- [ ] Inconsistent error wrapping at `aws.go:226`
- [ ] Should use `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` for proper wrapping
- **Impact:** Error type checking with `errors.Is()` fails
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:226`

- [ ] Use single constant for version
- **Impact:** Version drift possible if updated in one place only
- **Location:** `internal/main.go:41,165`

### P3.4 Cost Monitor Region Hardcoded ❌

- [ ] Cost monitor always uses `us-east-1` (at `main.go:113`)

- [ ] Make cost monitor region consistent
- **Impact:** Cost data may not reflect actual deployment regions
- **Location:** `internal/main.go:113`

### P3.5 Unused Error Types ❌
