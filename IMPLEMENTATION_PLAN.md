- [x] Update ALB target group health checks (`aws.go:865`)
- [x] 5 hardcoded port 80 references across `aws.go`
- **Impact:** Cannot deploy apps on non-80 ports (Node.js uses 3000, Go uses 8080, etc.)
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Completed:** ContainerPort parameter added with default value of 80

### P1.4 Health Check Path Not Configurable ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add `health_check_path` input parameter

- **Impact:** Default works for standalone deployments; may conflict with VPC peering
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Note:** Implemented as part of P1.11 private subnet architecture

- **Impact:** ECS tasks now isolated in private subnets; improved security posture
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`, `internal/state/types.go`, `internal/providers/aws_test.go`

- [x] Implement wait for ECS service to reach RUNNING state
- [x] Check ALB health check passes
- [x] Spec `ralph/specs/aws-provider.md` requires waiting for healthy deployment
- **Impact:** Users think deployment succeeded when it may still be starting/failing
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Verified returns immediately without waiting

### P1.15 Default Docker Image ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Default image is `nginx:latest` at `aws.go:787`
- [x] Should require explicit image specification or document default clearly
- [x] Now requires explicit `image_ref` parameter - no nginx:latest default
- **Impact:** Accidental deployments with wrong image
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:787`
- **Resolution:** Removed nginx:latest default. The `image_ref` parameter is now required and must be explicitly specified by the user.

### P1.16 Log Retention Hardcoded ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] CloudWatch log retention hardcoded to 7 days at `aws.go:749`
- [x] Make configurable per deployment
- [x] Now configurable via `log_retention_days` parameter
- **Impact:** Cannot retain logs longer for compliance/debugging
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:749`
- **Resolution:** Added `log_retention_days` parameter to make CloudWatch log retention configurable per deployment.

- **Impact:** Apps may run out of resources; no way to allocate more
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:806-807`
- **Resolution:** Added `cpu` and `memory` parameters to make ECS task resources configurable per deployment.

### P1.18 Error Wrapping Breaks errors.Is() ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Inconsistent error wrapping at `aws.go:226`
- [x] Should use `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` for proper wrapping
- **Impact:** Error type checking with `errors.Is()` fails
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:226`
- **Resolution:** Error wrapping was fixed as part of the P0.1 implementation when ErrPlanNotApproved was wired in. Verified that `%w` is used consistently for error wrapping throughout the codebase.

## P3 — Quality Improvements

### P3.1 AWS Reconciliation Lacks Pagination ❌

- [ ] Add pagination support for `DescribeVpcs`
- [ ] Add pagination support for `ListClusters`
- [ ] Add pagination support for `DescribeLoadBalancers`
- [ ] Handle large deployments (>100 resources per API call)
- **Impact:** Reconciliation may miss resources in large AWS accounts
- **Location:** `internal/state/reconcile.go`
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Verified no pagination implemented

### P3.2 Inefficient ALB Tag Fetching ❌

- [ ] Currently makes individual tag API calls per ALB
- [ ] Batch tag fetching for multiple resources
- **Impact:** Performance issues with many ALBs
- **Location:** `internal/state/reconcile.go`

### P3.3 Version String Duplicated ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Consolidate version "v0.1.0" (appears at `main.go:41` and `main.go:165`)
- [x] Use single constant for version
- **Impact:** Version drift possible if updated in one place only
- **Location:** `internal/main.go:41,165`
- **Completed:** 2026-03-25
- **Details:** Added Version variable at package level; both log message and MCP Implementation use the constant; Makefile injects version from git via ldflags

### P3.4 Cost Monitor Region Hardcoded ❌

- [ ] Cost monitor always uses `us-east-1` (at `main.go:113`)
- [ ] Reconciliation region is configurable via `-reconcile-region` flag
- [ ] Make cost monitor region consistent
- **Impact:** Cost data may not reflect actual deployment regions
- **Location:** `internal/main.go:113`

### P3.5 Unused Error Types ❌

- [ ] Review 3 unused error types: `ErrPlanNotApproved`, `ErrProvisioningFailed`, `ErrInvalidState`
- [ ] Either use them appropriately in P1.13/P1.14 or remove dead code
- **Impact:** Code clutter; misleading error handling patterns
- **Location:** `internal/errors/errors.go`
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Verified 3 unused types

### P3.6 planInfra Cost Estimate Disclaimer ❌

- [ ] Update planInfra output to clearly indicate estimate is approximate
- [ ] Add disclaimer when using hardcoded values (until P1.1 done)
- **Impact:** Users may rely on inaccurate estimates
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go:152`

### P3.7 Makefile Missing Targets ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Add `coverage` target (with `-coverprofile`)
- [x] Add `coverage-html` target
- [x] Add `test-race` target
- [x] Add `install` target
- [x] Add `run` target
- [x] Add `all` target
- [x] Add `help` target
- **Impact:** Developer experience; missing common workflows
- **Location:** `Makefile`
- **Completed:** 2026-03-25
- **Details:** Added all, test-race, coverage, coverage-html, run, install, help targets; improved clean target; updated test target

### P3.8 Logging Config AddTime Field Unused ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] `AddTime` field in `internal/logging/Config` is defined but never used
- [x] Either implement time addition logic or remove the field
- **Impact:** Dead code; confusing API
- **Location:** `internal/logging/logging.go`
- **Audit (2026-03-20):** Discovered unused field
- **Completed:** 2026-03-25
- **Details:** Removed unused AddTime field from logging.Config; slog handlers already include timestamps by default

---

## P5 — Stretch Goals

### P5.1 CloudFormation-based provisioning

- [ ] Use CloudFormation stacks instead of individual API calls
- [ ] Enables atomic create/teardown
- **Impact:** Simplifies `createInfra` and `teardown` significantly
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`

### P5.2 Additional cloud providers

- [ ] **GCP Provider** — new file `internal/providers/gcp.go`, register in `All()`
- [ ] **Azure Provider** — new file `internal/providers/azure.go`, register in `All()`
- **Depends on:** Shared state model

### P5.3 Secrets Management

- [ ] Integrate AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store
- [ ] Add `secrets` input to deploy tool
- [ ] Secure secret injection into containers
- **Impact:** No way to pass sensitive configuration securely
- **Location:** `internal/providers/aws.go`
- **Depends on:** P1.6 (environment variables)
